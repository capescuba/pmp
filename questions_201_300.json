System: It looks like the artifact generation was interrupted mid-question. I'll complete the JSON file `questions_201_300.json` with 100 unique PMP questions (IDs 201–300), ensuring they are distinct from the original 100 questions and the previously generated `questions_101_200.json`. The questions will follow the same structure, balance across PMI domains (Process: ~50%, People: ~35%, Business Environment: ~15%), and cover various knowledge areas (e.g., Scope, Cost, Agile, Stakeholder Management). I’ll also address your request for bulk generation of the remaining 8 files (IDs 301–1100) by providing a plan to deliver them efficiently.

### Completed Artifact
Below is the complete `questions_201_300.json` with 100 questions.
